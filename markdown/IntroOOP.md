C++ supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which lets you organize code by creating objects. These objects bundle data (attributes) and the functions (methods) that operate on that data. This approach offers several benefits:

* **Modularization:** Code is broken into manageable units.
* **Reusability:** Objects can be reused in different parts of your program or even in other programs.
* **Maintainability:** Code is easier to understand and modify.

Here are some key OOP concepts in C++:

1. **Classes and Objects:** A class is a blueprint that defines the properties (data members) and behaviors (member functions) of an object. An object is an instance of a class, meaning it's a specific realization of the class with its own set of data values.

2. **Encapsulation:** This concept bundles data and the functions that operate on it together within a class. This protects the data from being accessed or modified directly from outside the class.

3. **Abstraction:** Abstraction focuses on providing only essential information about an object while hiding the implementation details. This simplifies code and makes it easier to understand how objects are used.

4. **Inheritance:** Inheritance allows you to create new classes (derived classes) that inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes (base classes). This promotes code reuse and avoids redundancy.

5. **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to respond differently to the same message (function call). This enables flexible and dynamic behavior in your programs.

By understanding these core OOP concepts, you can write more structured, maintainable, and reusable C++ code.
